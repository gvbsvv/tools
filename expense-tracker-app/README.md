## Project Structure

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ app/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ globals.css      # Global styles and Tailwind CSS
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layout.tsx       # Root layout component

â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ExpenseList.tsx  # Expense listing component

## Key Components

- **ExpenseForm**: Handles adding and editing expenses with form validation
- **ExpenseList**: Displays expenses in a organized list with edit/delete actions
- **ExpenseChart**: Shows pie charts, bar charts, and category breakdowns
- **ExpenseStats**: Displays key metrics like total expenses, monthly spending, and averages

## Data Storage

The application uses localStorage to persist data locally in your browser. This means:
- Data is saved automatically when you add/edit/delete expenses
- Data persists between browser sessions
- Data is specific to the browser and device you're using

## Customization

### Adding New Categories

To add new expense categories, modify the `categories` array in `src/components/ExpenseForm.tsx`:

```typescript
const categories = [
  'Food & Dining',
  'Transportation',
  // Add your new categories here
  'Your New Category',
]
```

### Styling

The application uses Tailwind CSS for styling. You can customize the appearance by:
- Modifying the CSS variables in `src/app/globals.css`
- Updating Tailwind classes in individual components
- Extending the Tailwind config in `tailwind.config.ts`

## Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server with Turbopack
